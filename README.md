## üß† Core Concepts

### Neural Networks vs. Deep Learning

* **Neural Networks:** Models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected neurons arranged in layers.
* **Deep Learning:** A subset of neural networks using multiple hidden layers, enabling automatic feature abstraction and solving complex tasks (e.g., image recognition, NLP).

### Neuron Structure

Each artificial neuron consists of:

* **Inputs & Weights**: Multiplied together to assess significance
* **Summation**: Add all weighted inputs + bias
* **Activation Function**: Non-linear transformation (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)
* **Output**: Forwarded to next layer

### Network Architecture

* **Input Layer**: Receives raw data
* **Hidden Layers**: Perform transformations; more layers ‚Üí deeper learning
* **Output Layer**: Final decision or prediction
* **Bias**: Adjustable threshold improving learning flexibility

## üîÅ Learning Process

### Forward Propagation

* Flow of data from input to output layer
* Each layer computes output based on activation function

### Backpropagation

* Calculate error between predicted and actual output
* Error is propagated backward to adjust weights (using gradients)
* Optimization via gradient descent

### Overfitting and Prevention

* **Causes**: Too complex model, small dataset
* **Solutions**:

  * Regularization (L2, dropout)
  * Early stopping
  * Cross-validation
  * Data augmentation

### Cross-Validation

* **K-fold split**: Data divided into K parts
* Train/test K times, rotating validation set
* Averages accuracy across folds ‚Üí better generalization

## ü§ñ Advanced Classification Techniques (Scikit-learn)

* Applied to **MNIST** (handwritten digit recognition)
* Techniques:

  * Binary classification with SGDClassifier
  * Confusion matrix & precision/recall analysis
  * Multi-class with SVM / OneVsRest
  * Multi-label (e.g., large & odd digits)
  * Multi-output (noise removal tasks)
